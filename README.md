# PyRankine

`PyRankine` is  a demo simulator of ideal rankine cycle based on [libseuif97](https://github.com/PySEE/SEUIF97) for Windows(64).

## Run

```
python rankine.py
```

   * Steam is the working fluid in an ideal Rankine cycle. 

   * Saturated vapor enters the turbine at 8.0 MPa 
   
   * Saturated liquid exits the condenser at a pressure of 0.008 MPa. 

   * The net power output of the cycle is 100 MW.

   * Cooling water enters the condenser at 15C and exits at 35C.

* Determine for the cycle

  * the thermal efficiency, %

  * the back work ratio,  %

  * the mass flow rate of the steam,in kg/h,

  * the rate of heat transfer, Qin, into the working fluid as it passes through the boiler, in MW,

  * the rate of heat transfer, Qout, from the condensing steam as it passes through the condenser, in MW,

  * the mass flow rate of the condenser cooling water, in kg/h
